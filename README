Sponsor: a Ruby on Rails app to support family sponsorship record-keeping for FAMA

The project was started at RailsCamp New England, March 2010. It is my first serious attempt at a Rails project, but it's a good motivation since I might actually use it.

Sadly, I have yet to come up with a clever name, and that's half the fun. Maybe later.

This would require much more generalisation if anyone were to use it for anything but the original purpose. (But that's why we have rapid development, right?) Standard disclaimers apply: your mileage may vary / caveat emptor / it's still in beta; etc.
